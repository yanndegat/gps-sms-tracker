* Description

I wanna bring on my pi when hiking/biking in 
bretagne/pays de la loire(france) to display a map of my
current gps location on my kobo aurora ereader, 
and my wife can ping my location by sending an sms

* SMS

use gammu-smsd with the smsdrc to execute the `./runonreceive.sh` script
when a sms is received.

The script answers back last known gps location

Whitelist phonenumbers in smsdrc

* GPS

  Read gps location and stores lat/lon/alt/date into sqlite db

** pre requisites

install racket 7

** build
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
 make -C gpsloc deps build
 #+END_SRC

** run
 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
DB=./locations.sqlite ACTION=loc TTY="/dev/ttyUSB1" sudo -E ./gpsloc
 #+END_SRC

** install 

Install systemd units to automatically crawl location fom gps and store it
on a local DB

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo make -C ./gpsloc install
 #+END_SRC



* Maps

Draws a map of current location (+gpx) from a static png mbtiles 
file served by a small mbtiles server

* Kobo eReader

Display map served by PI on eReader. refresh on timer

* Is this useful ? 

a ereader is useful for:

- reading maps under the sun
- saving batteries
- reading books at night

Ok, for smartphone+garmin owners, this is totally useless.
